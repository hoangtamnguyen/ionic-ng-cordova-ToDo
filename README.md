## Synopsis

An Ionic-AngularJS Todo Mobile App. 
Programmed using the Ionic Framework [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/).
Based on the example given on the Ionic Website.
The Ionic Framework allows native type mobile apps to be created using AngularJS, HTML5, 
CSS and Cordova/Phonegap

## Code Example

Allows projects to be created and deleted. Each project can contain a list of tasks.
Tasks can be created and deleted for each project.

Uses the following concepts:

side-menu			- navigation
template file 		- data stored in template-cache, allows code to be removed from 
					  Index.html - reduces clutter
html5 localstorage 	- for persistent storage 
checkbox input type - I did not use <ion-checkbox> as it did not work well for me along 
					  with <ion-list>
ng-change 			- to track changes to state of checkbox
option-buttons 		- used to show delete buttons for both projects and tasks




## Motivation

Learning AngularJS and how it can be used to create native type mobile phone Apps using 
Ionic, HTML5, CSS3 and Cordova
